* Piwikr *

* A collection of tools to assist in querying and managing a Piwik site. *

* Data Formats *

Piwik API calls support requested formats of XML, JSON, PHP, and CSV.
This library adds a 'ruby' format that will return the response data
as a Ruby object (whatever JSON parses that to be).

* Seeing the REST URL *

This gem uses rest-client for REST calls.  If you need to see the request
being set, then set a log by doing one of the following:

1) Set a RESTCLIENT_LOG environment variable to stdout, stderr, or a file.

2) Programmatically set the log:

   require "logger"
   RestClient.log = Logger.new(STDOUT)
