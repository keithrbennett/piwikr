An assembly of tools to assist in the operation and management of a Piwik site.

This gem uses rest-client for REST calls.  If you need to see the request
being set, then set a log by doing one of the following:

1) Set a RESTCLIENT_LOG environment variable to stdout, stderr, or a file.

2) Programmatically set the log:

   require "logger"
   RestClient.log = Logger.new(STDOUT)
